GREMLIN CHAOS ENGINEERING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction: 

    Chaos engineering is disciplined approach to identify failures before they become outages. 
    It is break things on purpose to identify more resilient systems.
    2010 - Netflix created Chaos monkey.
    2011 - Simian Army added additional failure injection on top of chaos monkey.
    Failure Injection testing (FIT). Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) in AWS.

Principles of Chaos Engineering:

    Plan an Experiment. (create an hypothesis)
    Contain the Blast radius. 
    Scale or Squash.

Benefits of Chaos Engineering:

    Increased availability.
    Lower MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)
    Lower MTTD (Mean Time to Detection)
    Fewer bugs.
    Fewer outages.

Fallacies of Distributed System:

    Network is reliable.
    Latency is zero.
    Bandwidth is infinite.
    Network is secure.
    Topology doesnot change.
    Transport cost is zero.
    One administrator.

Chaos Engineering Experiments:

    Known Knowns    :   Things you aware of and understand.    
    Known Unknowns  :   Things you aware of but not fully understand.
    Unknown Knowns  :   Things you not aware of but understand.
    Unknowm Unkowns :   Things not aware of and not fully understand.
